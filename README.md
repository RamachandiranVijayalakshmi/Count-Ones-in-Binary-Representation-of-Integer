# Count Ones in Binary Representation of Integer
- **Count the amount of ones in the binary representation of an integer**
- **So for example, since 12 is '1100' in binary, the return value should be 2**
- **The input will always be a valid integer (number)**
## Sample Code
```
return bin(b).count('1')
```
## Example Output
```
Enter the interger Value:100
